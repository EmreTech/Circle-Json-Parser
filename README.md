# Circle-Json-Parser

## DISCLAMIER

I am not in any way related to MeetCircle. This is just a small program I made in my free time.

In short, this downloads a locallly stored JSON file from the Disney Circle. It then parses the file using Json for Modern C++ and gives some possibly important information.

The information it gives at the moment is the following:
- What Categories are blacklisted (under time limits)
- When the bedtime limit starts/ends (if there is one)
- Category usage for today
- Speific website usage for today

There are a few delays before the next amount of information is given. This is on purpose so you have time to read the info.
